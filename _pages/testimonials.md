Here are some of the nice things people have said about our work:

> "Alex's technical architecture work on a new Kubernetes-deployed transactional engine was incredibly valuable.  He was a huge help in enabling our team to deliver some key milestones, and brings an unending positivity that really pulled us together."

> "Lightenna supported us on multiple business transformation projects over an 18-month period, ranging from digital strategy through to application architecture and Cloud migration.  Their technology and industry knowledge was first rate, but what really made the difference was the combination of hands-on-keyboard engineering and on-site training, allowing us to build our internal capability much quicker, and reduce our future reliance on expensive professional service support engagements."

> "Alex's software audit and report exceeded our expectations. Alex was focused, deliberate and thorough, and we would definitely work with him again."
