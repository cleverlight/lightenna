What is it?

Why does it accrue?

I can't see the future.  I can make an informed guess of what will happen in some areas of technology in the short to medium term, but I can't tell you in detail what's going to happen next year.  However recognising the limitations of my crystal-ball gazing is empowering.

Project teams deal with 0/20 hindsight using risk management.

When should it be remediated?

How much of it should we carry?
