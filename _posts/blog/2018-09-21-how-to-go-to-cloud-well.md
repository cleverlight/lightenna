### Right-sized
Bigger consultancies sell the Cloud as a destination.
They propose elaborate and expensive Cloud frameworks, each unique and 'tailored' to your business.
If your world is sufficiently unchanging that you can design something now for well-understood future, then I guess their's is a relevant offering.

### Agile
However the digital world we live in is dynamic and fast-changing.
Massive visions and behemoth Cloud adoption strategies are comforting in their organised elegance, but fraught with risk.
Lean, test-and-learn, short-cycle iteration is taking us in a different direction.

Business live and die by their ability to get data, refine it into knowledge then use that to make good decisions about the short and medium term.
Reactive, and proactive, teams have the skills to embrace that change, adapt their knowledge and grow.

### Alike
The Cloud is incredibly generic.
While every snowflake business has a purpose, core logic and selling point that makes it unique, there's no reason why their server estates have to be so individual.
Every day developers, technical architects and specialists are designing improved re-usable components that can make your Cloud:
* more manageable
* more scalable
* more secure

### Open
These components are shared openly because their value is in application, not in abstract.
Earlier this year Lightenna released our [Cloud Starter](/tech/2018/cloud-starter/) training course open-source, so that others could benefit from that sharing in the same way we have.

> Lightenna can help your teams maximise the value of open-source and free software.  

### Starting with people
Instead of shooting for the moon or buying into a seven-figure, multi-year plan, I'd like to advocate a different approach.
A box on a diagram has a nice simplicity, but the business outcomes associated with Cloud success have people at their core.
