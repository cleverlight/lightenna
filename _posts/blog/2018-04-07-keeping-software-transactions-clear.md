title: Buying software with integrity 
description: The ephemeral nature of a digital download can make for murky transactions.  What we need isn't a 40-page EULA, it's a clear agreement of how and how long the software will work.

With each new iteration, technology makes the status quo look its age. Nothing dates faster than the introduction of a younger model. 'New' carries with it an expectation of faster, better, brighter, lighter but it's hard to separate the marketing hype from the substantially improved customer experience.

New can also mean a retrograde step in functionality, temporarily on the promise that the bugs will get worked out. How long are we expected to wait for normal service to be restored?

My new phone carries Android 8 Oreo. Several apps I use regularly don't work well with Android 8 - LastPass I'm looking at you given that you tripled in price for my last renewal - but it's the apps that don't work at all that really cause issues. Some kind of form field bug seems to affect the taxi app I use, rendering it incapable of booking taxis. "Pick up the phone" you say, and you'd be right, but now the voice channel carries a small but measurable financial impediment. In a few months time, most Android phones will be on 8, but until then developers don't patch their apps and function suffers. Most mobile app revenues are based on one-off payments, so the only incentive to the developer to patch at all is to access new customers. They'd have every right not to patch at all!

The social contract around software is changing. I paid £140 for Quickbooks 2004. At the time the expectation was that it would last a couple of years, unless I wanted the latest features. That amortized to about £50 per year based on a fairly pessimistic 3 year projection - some users have successfully used it for 14 years!

Nowadays Quickbooks costs about £15-47 per month. I use Quickbooks for about 30 hours per year, which makes it a very expensive tool. It does its job no better than before. The utility of Quickbooks hasn't grown substantially, but the proportion of my business' income spent on it has.

My screen recorder software - Camtasia Studio 8 - doesn't work with the latest version of Windows. Only the upgrade works, but that costs another $100. When I bought the software, I didn't get a 1 or 2 year subscription. I bought it in perpetuity.  There was no warning or limitation placed on the use of the software, so the post-upgrade error messages were a surprise.  Had I been told "you're buying an annual subscription", I probably wouldn't have gone with this program.

There are no absolutes here. Developers need to get paid and maintenance should be funded, but there's also an obligation on those who make software to be transparent about what we as consumers are buying.  The transaction needs to be clear.  Muddying that in the interests of securing a sale, only to later reneg on the agreement risks alienating customers.
