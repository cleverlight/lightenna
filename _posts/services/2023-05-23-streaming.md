description: If you're running an in-person event that not everyone can attend, we can stream it to broaden your audience online.  Afterwards, an archive copy gives you a record for posterity or those who couldn't tune in live.

# Unobtrusive recording and streaming

Every event is different so we customise our offering based on your needs.  Our goal is to ensure that fundamentally the staff who couldn't be in the room can still get a clear sense of what's going on.  We can even provide back-channels to allow interaction from those joining online.

Each streamed event typically includes:
* Multi-camera setup
* Multi-microphone setup including radio mics for presenters
* Minimal disruption with only 1 or 2 engineers/camera-people
* Streaming online using your existing network
* Secure delivery to ensure closed meetings and sensitive content are handled appropriately

# Save the moments that not everyone can attend in person
