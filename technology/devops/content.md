
## Culture

* Neither a set of tools
* Nor a role
* DevOps as a collaboration

Note: I like the Peter Drucker quote "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."  It's hugely over-used but as relevant for DevOps [as it was for motorcars when Mark Fields referenced it](https://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/organisational-culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast-lunch-and-dinner/).

Note: Collaboration has yielded most of the world's greatest online projects, but managed poorly it can carry a high cost.  The old "how many X does it take to change a lightbulb?" joke owes its creation to redundant collaboration.

All projects, whether compose of 2 or 200 participants, are searching for the right balance of collaborative activity and skilled individual effort.
