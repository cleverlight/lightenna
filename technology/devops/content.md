* Neither a set of tools
* Nor a role
* DevOps as a collaboration

Note: I like the Peter Drucker quote "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."  It's hugely over-used but as relevant for DevOps [as it was for motorcars when Mark Fields referenced it](https://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/organisational-culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast-lunch-and-dinner/).
