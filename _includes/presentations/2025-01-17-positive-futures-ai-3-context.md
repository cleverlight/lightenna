## Quality of AI

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

AI improving is not news.  The quality of the outputs of AI models is going to carry on improving.
It may eventually be bounded by the availability of high-quality training data, but even that is debatable.
I'm pretty sure AI is going to be valuable for organisations and individuals alike.

## Investment

...so does most of the tech sector.  That's why major ICT companies are investing so heavily.

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

Generative AI investment figures aren't available for 2024-2025 yet, but I expect them to be higher than these 2023 figures.

## Not news
+ Quality and investment trends are not surprising
+ Growth is inevitable
+ Not about parameter count
+ Not about prompts

![What context means]({{ "/assets/images/presentation_resources/2025-01-17/prompt-vs-context.png" | absolute_url }})

---

## What bigger context means

+ 1M token window
+ Equivalent to roughly 800,000 words
  + Shakespeare's complete works
  + 2000 pages of text

## Reaction to growth

> "I canâ€™t emphasize enough how **mind-blowing** extremely long token context windows are..."

[Ted Xiao on X](https://x.com/xiao_ted/status/1761865996716114412)

---

> "For both AI researchers and practitioners, massive context windows will have transformative long-term impact, beyond one or two flashy news cycles."

## AI now

+ AI is knowledgeable
+ AI has near instant recall
+ Scalable
+ Works 24/7
+ Not perfect, expensive, hallucinations
+ Constantly improving

---

## 2000 pages of...

+ Product briefs
+ Technical manuals
+ EPKs
+ Company blogs
+ Emails
+ Roadmaps
+ Design documents
+ Repositories of source code

---

## What it means for business

+ Business-specific context
+ Up to now, AI has been a smart new hire
+ Long context allows AI to be a wise old-timer

---

## Buy vs build

+ Can train your own models
  + but can you compete with the big players?
+ Can feed existing models with context
+ Can feed future models with context
+ Hype warning
