## Philosophy

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}
When thinking about a Cloud platform, a lot of the discuss is about nuts and bolts;
who to use; how much is it going to cost; when will it be ready?

But before you race off to AWS/Azure with a credit card, it's worth thinking a little about how your organisation as a whole wants to work in the Cloud.

## Axes
* Project vs Organisation
* Autonomy vs Control
* Subscription services vs Built services

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}
What degree of autonomy will projects have?
How is responsibility going to be split between projects and the organisation as a whole?
How will governance work?

These questions connect with similar ones from our [web audit framework](/tech/2018/web-audit-spice/) about how much vendor lock-in you'd be willing to live with?
Subscription (SaaS) services offer a fast way to implement new features, but when their bespoke APIs get baked into your applications, they become hard to uncouple.
