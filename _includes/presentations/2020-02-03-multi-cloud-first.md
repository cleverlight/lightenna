## Why Multi-cloud at all?
+ Vendor competition
+ Commoditised resources
+ Long-term price resilience
+ Wider opportunity surface

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

---

## Downside
+ Increased complexity
+ Not viable with click-and-tick
+ Requires infrastructure-as-code
+ Exposure to more intra-cloud changes
+ Little inter-cloud standardisation

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

---

## Bigger upside
+ Infrastructure-as-code
+ Terraform as cloud standardisation layer
+ Puppet for configuration management
+ K8s/Docker app standard platform
+ Free Devops-Workstream reference implementation

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

---

## Multi-cloud first
+ Avoid single-vendor offerings
+ Avoid vendor lock-in
+ Keep vendors competitive
+ Ensure solid architecture
+ Stay agile to seize next opportunity
